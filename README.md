Gnieh Coroutines
================

Introduction
------------

Gnieh Coroutines is a [Scala][1] library and a compiler plugin which makes it possible to use coroutines in Scala.
The design is based on coroutines in LUA [2][2][3][3] and natively implements asymmetric coroutines.

This project is still at an really early stage and is not finished yet. Any comments are welcome.
